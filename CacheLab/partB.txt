DESCRIPTION
       man is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to  man  is
       normally  the  name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page

DESCRIPTION
       grep  searches  for  PATTERN  in  each  FILE.  A FILE of “-” stands for
       standard input.  If no FILE is given, recursive  searches  examine  the
       working  directory,  and nonrecursive searches read standard input.  By
       default, grep prints the matching lines.
