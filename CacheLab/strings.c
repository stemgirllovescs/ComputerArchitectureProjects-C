/****************************************
 * This series of tasks is meant to
 * help you better understand how strings
 * and the string.h library work in C. 
 * Given the skeleton code, your task is 
 * to fix or finish the code to provide 
 * the desired output.
 * 
 * One notable difference between Java and
 * C is that there is no String data type
 * in C. Instead, we just represent strings
 * as contiguous arrays of characters that
 * end with a null-terminator '\0' character.
 * 
 * This also means that certain nice 
 * utilities from java like string length,
 * comparison, etc. aren't available by
 * default. There is, however, a library
 * string.h which is included at the top
 * of this file, that brings back these 
 * utilities. Many of its functions have 
 * their own manual pages as well, so
 * "man strlen" in the terminal will 
 * provide information about the strlen()
 * function, for example.

 * The given example is missing a null
 * terminator, which you need to fix.

/***************************************
 * Use the toupper() standard library
 * function to convert the given string's
 * characters to upper case. Note that 
 * this function handles non-letter 
 * characters for you, so you don't need 
 * to consider them here. 
 * 
 * There is also a bug in getting the 
 * length of the string, which you will 
 * need to fix as well. 
 * Using the strlen() function will help.
